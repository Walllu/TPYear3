Day 1 - 11:35 25.9.2018
Starting up the Linux environment, reading through the course notes...
Created a personal directory for the time being, in Desktop, called "2270077". I'll move that out to Github once it's set up, or in the worst case scenario, store it on a USB flash drive.
Tried cloning my Github repo, first config'd myself, but I'm getting a funny error

	[guest@localhost 2270077]$ git clone https://github.com/Walllu/TPYear3.git
	Cloning into 'TPYear3'...
	fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Walllu/TPYear3.git/': Failed connect to github.com:443; Connection refused

I'll just ignore that for now...

11:46
Following along with the 1.2 --> "pwd" and "man pages"
1.2 TASK go to the "pwd" man page using "man pwd" and scroll up/down, leaving with "Q"
1.2 TASK use "cd .." to go up a directory. This would take me up to "Desktop", I can see this with pwd.
1.2 TASK use "ls" to list the contents of a directory. "ls /l" is for "long form" so to view the contents of the "home" directory, we can just type>
	[guest@localhost 2270077]$ ls -l /home
	total 4
	drwx------. 32 guest guest 4096 Sep 25 10:41 guest
Learning about the "cp" and "mv" commands. I didn't know for sure about how user permissions on files and directories affect these commands, but it says here clearly that it can be affected. Also, the wildcard "*" is a handy thing that I forgot about. Is this "globbing" or am I remembering something else... Anyways, regex would be cool to have in terminal.
I'm gonna play around with EMACs a bit, I think notetaking might be nicer in ORG-mode than in a plain text file... Ok, I gave up pretty quickly. I'll look into that later, I need to brush up on EMACs but now's no time to do that.

12:00
Continuing on.
1.2 TASK exploring the man pages of the commands in Table 1. I'll have a look at chmod, grep, top
1.3 Your path ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found a typo< "indicted" --> "indicated"
1.3 TASK type "echo $PATH" to see what happens. 
	[guest@localhost 2270077]$ echo $PATH
	/home/guest/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/home/guest/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
These are all the directory locations (":" separated) that Linux looks into when you type in a program name i.e. a command. These are where all of the traditional Linux terminal commands are stored.
You can run the bash script 'PATH="$PATH:$HOME/mydirectory"' to add a directory to the path.
1.3 TASK add a directory to your home directory, called "bin", and add that to $PATH with the above.
There's already a directory called "bin" there, containing some empty shell scripts. I did "rm -r ./bin" and made a new one (though tbh I didn't have to), and now I'm gonna run the above bash script. I'm unsure now, I have it in the PATH variable, but it says>
	[guest@localhost ~]$ $PATH
	bash: /home/guest/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/home/guest/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/home/guest/bin: No such file or directory
so yeah, a little conflicted. How can I remove the last item in this string?

12:17 section 1.4
Quick run down of neat tricks in BASH terminal, including autocomplete, command history, and piping/output.

12:20 Chapter 2, section 2.1
Oh! We're gonna use EMACs, wonderful. I've used VIM so I might skip this section, but should I...?
Yeah. I'll look at this later......

12:22 Chapter 3 Automation and Coding: Shell Scripts, C++
3 TASK check to see if the "bin" we made earlier is in the path. I'm a little skeptical, given the earlier error-y message appended to the end of the PATH variable string. Let's see. Looking again, it says "No directory" but checking with "ls -l" we can clearly see it's there, and it's a directory, wth
Ok, well, I'm going to add the code to my bashrc file.
3 TASK navigate to the web page linked to in the PDF... http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_writing_shell_scripts.php

12:48
I'm reading through the section on "here" scripts in BASH, and it's pretty interesting. I'm just reading through this stuff, because most of it isn't new per se, but revising is always good and mostly necessary.
"Stubbing" is an interesting programming technique, though not really something I realized had a name, though, also, perhaps this author just made that name up for himself, it's such a common thing to do while developing a program.
In the "Watch Your Script Run" section in "Stay Out Of Trouble", I didn't know it was possible to get your BASH script to display the "expanded" lines of code while it's running. It's called "tracing" apparently, which is pretty cool!

13:15
3 TASK write a shell script called "welcome.sh" that can do all the things a real boy can do. I did it, and it works as it should (using the "date" command)
3 TASK go back to the beginning and read the script. Do you understand it? Yes.

13:20 Compiling C++ programs
You can compile C++ programs in BASH by using the "g++" command. "gcc" is for C.

14:07 Back from lunch. So it seems compiling in g++ is pretty much the same as gcc.
3.2 TASK compile some code... I did it! Though the "c.in" call makes the program (I guess) look for user input, which is a little annoying and presumptuous for a "hello world" program I think. So I removed it, without errors, and recompiled it, and so I'm now happy with my C++ skills.

14:16 Chapter 4 Visualizing Data: Gnuplot
Now comes the good stuff! 
4 TASK read the following web pages on gnuplot 
http://web.archive.org/web/20100726165306/ <-------------------- Also this one!
http://t16web.lanl.gov/Kawano/gnuplot/index-e.html <------------ This one seems to be broken!
This is going well.... 
4 TASK copy the C++ file from the web page, and compile it. Run the program, producing the data.
4 TASK write a gnuplot script to plot the data in your "dat" file, and output as an "encapsulated postscript" file called "gaussian.eps" or just save as jpeg etc. etc.

14:30
Well, using other online resources (namely Google) I got something working. I used http://www.gnuplotting.org/plotting-data/  and, by using the C++ file in the course notes, I produced the Gaussian distributed data in a data file I called "out.dat", and used a strange incantation to product a nice gaussian distribution graph. The incantation is as follows...
	gnuplot> set style line 1 \
	>linecolor rgb '#0060ad' \
	>linetype 1 linewidth 2 \
	>pointtype 7 pointsize 1.5
	gnuplot> plot 'out.dat' with linespoints linestyle 1

More resources I'm using:
	http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/
	https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~vrable/gnuplot/using-gnuplot.html
	https://andy-carter.com/blog/automating-gnuplot-with-scripting
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35785030/plot-multiple-datasets-from-one-file?rq=1

4 TASK plot 3 gaussian distributions with same mean but different std.
Ok, I'm doing something a little bit hacky, but at this point what can you expect. I'm modifying the code to do the same thing three times. Let's see... ok nevermind it won't work hmmmm...

15:11
I'm looking at some demos on the gnuplot web site, and found one for plotting multiple functions at the same time, but nothing necessarily for plotting multiple data sets at the same time. I'll continue investigating. I just found some information on StackOverflow on the formatting of the data sets. I'll modify the original code to do this, and see what happens.

15:34
Alright! I managed to modify the code, getting it to generate three gaussian distribution's worth of data, storing it all in the same file, and with the following gnuplot incantation, we get three gaussian distribution curves on the same plot!
	set key autotitle columnheader
	stats 'file.dat' using 0 nooutput
	plot for [i=0:(STATS_blocks - 1)] 'file.dat' using 1:2 index i
I can't figure out how to save the plot as a jpeg yet though...
I just found a web page (http://www.math.utk.edu/~vasili/refs/How-to/gnuplot.print.html) with some tips on this, I'm going to try it out... Yay it works. Ok.
So the following incantation is what I used to produce the "multig.png" file>
	gnuplot> set term png
	Terminal type set to 'png'
	Options are 'nocrop font "/usr/share/fonts/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf,12" fontscale 1.0 size 640,480 '
	gnuplot> set output "multig.png"
	gnuplot> replot




Thursday 27.9.2018 --
Alright, looking back at what I did for the previous TASKs, I realize that I need to create a "gnuplot script" called "gaussian.gnu". I've made it for the single gaussian distribution case, now to do the same for the multiple gaussian distributions. OK! I got that working with some fanagling...

12:06
TASK similarly produce a 2D plot showing the gaussian distribution... How the heck can I do this.
I guess it's a heatmap, so I'll have a look to see what I can find online.
	http://lowrank.net/gnuplot/intro/basic-e.html
I can't really figure it out. I'll ask for help.

12:32
In fact, I think I'll move onto the next section for now. I feel like I need to read up a bit more on gnuplot.

The vector Gaussian distribution can be reexpressed in component form, and, in the numerator of the exponent, we are left with a vector dot product which simplifies the expression to a multivariable function of x and y. I'm going to redo the C++ code.

14:50
I finally finished the two dimensional gaussian distribution program and gnuplot. I simply made the output print into an X,Y,Z column, with rows separated by a empty string. In gnunplot, I followed the code in the gnuplot heatmap demo (http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/heatmaps.html) using that data format. I editted the "rgbformula" bit to "21,22,23" to get the same color scheme as well.

14:58
Time to look at the final task of this section.
TASK play around with the data from the following url (http://www.christophenglert.co.uk/histograms.tar.gz) and create histograms. Doesn't work, but the stuff is on Moodle.

I don't understand what this "mZZ" thing is that they mention, it's not quite clear from the text.


TASK follow a tutorial to LaTeX.
Alright, I'll leave that off for today. I'll continue reading at home.


Tuesday 2.10.2018 --
I've been reading about C++ and LaTeX over the weekend, and now I'll go through the C++ portion of the lab.
My program is behaving somewhat strangely. When representing the change as a float or a double, in some cases subtracting 0.1 from 0.1 (as an example) seems to create a slightly negative number! My program is to find the least amount of notes needed to give a customer as change, and this seems from the outset, a very simple problem to write a program for. So I thought to subtract a note, test if it's positive or negative, and act accordingly, passing it down to the point where we're giving pennies. But this strange thing has even the demonstrator confounded. My solution to this is to multiply the user's input (not testing, or cleaning, the data very much) by a factor of 100, and treating the amount as an integer. By rights, 0.1 - 0.1 = 0.0, but we're seeing 0.1 - 0.1 = 1.56299e-15 !!!
The program is working now, with the integer conversion. I still want an explanation for this strange behavior from before. It must have something to do with rounding errors, as the double representation saw a much smaller error than the float representation, as one would expect.

Task: Write a C++ program to convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and
Kelvin. The program should ask for the temperature in Fahrenheit from the user and
return the Celsius and Kelvin values.

This went off without much of a hitch. I learned that (5/9) returns the nearest floored integer, which, in this case, was 0. That's not very helpful when converting F to C/K, so I had to represent this fraction as (5.0/9.0)...


Task: The Fibonacci sequence {a n } is defined by ...
Write a C++ program which takes an integer as input from the user and returns a_n.

I could interpret this as meaning "Accept integer input, and return that index of the Fibonacci sequence.
This is a famous (well, I say famous...) example of a programming problem where recursion is useful. I'll write a fibonacci function and give it a go...
It works well, up to the 47th index, after this the integer gets overflowed, for example the 47th index returned gives..
	Type in the index of the Fibonacci you would like to see.
	47
	-1323752223
And after this, the program fails to produce any numbers at all, as it then subtracts the overflow from the 46th index (+) + (-) = (+) until it overflows again.
I first considered reimplementing this with "long int"s, but then just decided to add a check to see if it overflowed, and then print "overflow error" once it happens.


Task: Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 1 and
1000 and tells them whether or not it is a prime number.

What's the best way to test primality? I've checked for input==2, and input%2==0, the simple cases. But, considering the limited range of numbers we're considering, perhaps I could slap together kinda simplistic.
Alright, my program appears to work. First I check for the starting prime numbers, and whether or not the number is even. Then I successively divide the number by all the odd numbers less than it, until either we find a counter example, or we end at the top of the list, at which time we figure out that the number is prime! This method theoretically works for all numbers (not just those between 1 and 1000) but it would take a long time, and perhaps the number cannot be represented in the computer as before, so it has it's limitations.


TASK Write a program that allows the user to enter an arbitrary (i.e. user defined) number of real numbers, and returns their mean and standard deviation.
I implemented this by first asking the user the number of data points they would like to input, then the user input the numbers one at a time. The program stores these in an array of size "size" determined by how many data points they wanted to input. Then, it's a simple calculation of the mean, then the standard deviation (I calculated the sample standard deviation in my program).

Task: Write a program which counts (and returns) the number of characters in its
own source code file, excluding blanks.

I had to do some Googling, and found some code that uses streams and strings to read in a files, and go through the text line by line. I then found how to read in the line as a string, and furthermore found out how to count the number of characters in that string. I just needed to remove all the blank characters (whitespaces, tabs) and count what is left, and add that to a running total, to get the final answer.


Task: Repeat the earlier task where you returned the nth term of the Fibonacci
sequence, but this time, implement it in a function (i.e. fib(n) returns the integer a n ).
Don’t use any loops - do it entirely with a (single) function. -----------------------------------------> I just read this, and I realize that this is how I originally implemented it. Do I need to make it again?

Task: Write a program that uses 2-dimensional arrays to multiply together two user
defined matrices.

I'm thinking now about how we should accept input from the user. How can the user input the numbers? CSV format from the CLI? I still don't know how to split a string by commas, but I guess this is a good opportunity to do so... Ok, I've implemented that. But how do we show the user the matrix? Printing them out one by one seems rough but it's all I can think of... Well, I implemented that, as well as the matrix multiplication. I did this in a very rudimentary way, the way we're taught in high school. Right now, the program ask you for the dimensions of the LHS matrix, then you're prompted to input the values of the elements at each location first in the LHS matrix, then the RHS matrix. It then outputs the result of the multiplication to the command line. Fiddling around with the indices was so much fun. /s
